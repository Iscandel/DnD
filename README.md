# DnD
DnD is a computer remake of an old electronic board game.  
It is a turn based game, where the players try to find and bring back a treasure, while avoiding an invisible dragoon. Most of the game rules are implemented, excluding random doors concept.  
The application features a single player mode and a multiplayer mode (same screen or network connection).
